## Prerequisites

- A dedicated server with root access running a rescue system (e.g., provided by your hosting provider).
- Internet connectivity to download the Proxmox VE ISO and required packages.
- A VNC viewer application (e.g., RealVNC, TightVNC) installed on your local machine.
- Basic understanding of Linux command-line operations.

## Connecting to the Rescue System

Before running the script, you'll need to boot your server into a **rescue system** (also known as recovery mode). Here's how to connect to the rescue system, specifically on a **Hetzner dedicated server**. These steps should be similar for other hosting providers that offer a rescue environment.

### Steps to Access the Rescue System on Hetzner:

1. **Activate Rescue System from Hetzner Robot:**
   - Log in to your Hetzner Robot dashboard: [Hetzner Robot](https://robot.your-server.de).
   - Select your dedicated server from the list.
   - Under the "Rescue" tab, activate the rescue system.
   - Select the **Linux 64-bit rescue image**.
   - Set or note down the rescue system password (you can also generate a new one if needed).
   - Click **Activate Rescue System**.

2. **Reboot Your Server into the Rescue System:**
   - After activating the rescue system, go to the "Reset" tab in Hetzner Robot.
   - Click **Execute hardware reset** to reboot your server into the rescue system.

3. **Connect via SSH:**
   - Once the server reboots into the rescue system, you should receive an email from Hetzner with SSH connection details (your server's IP address and the root password).
   - Open your terminal and connect to the server using SSH:
   
     ```bash
     ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
     ```

   - Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with your actual server's IP address.
   - When prompted, enter the rescue system password.

4. **Verify Rescue System:**
   - Once logged in, verify that you are in the rescue system by running the following command:
   
     ```bash
     uname -a
     ```
   
   - It should display information about the Linux rescue environment.

### Steps for Other Providers:

If you're using a hosting provider other than Hetzner, the general process to access the rescue system should be similar:

1. Log in to your hosting provider's management dashboard.
2. Locate the option to boot into the rescue or recovery system.
3. Follow the steps to activate the rescue mode and reboot your server.
4. Connect to the server via SSH using the provided credentials or root password.

Once you are connected to the rescue system, you can proceed with the [Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions).
